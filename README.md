# KDtree-And-LSH-Implementation

These are the implementations I did as a part of the course ES335: Machine Learning, taught in the Fall semester of session 2024-25. The question:

2. In this question you will implement and compare the following different KNN variants (see: https://youtu.be/C9HQLyXwEw0?t=3382)  
- LSH (1 marks)
- KD-tree (1 marks)
- Naive version of KNN (0.5 marks)

Vary dataset size `N`, number of dimensions `D` to do training and testing time and memory comparison for finding `K` nearest neighbours. (1 mark)
